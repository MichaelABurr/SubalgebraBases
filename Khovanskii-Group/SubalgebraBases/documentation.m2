     subalgebra basis (sagbi basis)
   Usage
     N = sagbi M
     N = sagbi A
     N = sagbi L
   Inputs
     A:Subring
     M:Matrix
       of generators for a subring of @ ofClass{PolynomialRing} @
     L:List
       containing generators for a subring of @ ofClass{PolynomialRing} @
     Limit=>ZZ
       a degree limit for the binomial S-pairs that are computed internally.
     PrintLevel=>ZZ

       Whether to perform autosubduction on the generators before performing the Sagbi basis computation (See: @TO "Autosubduce"@)
   Outputs
     N:Matrix
       whose entries form a partial subalgebra basis
   Description
    Text
        The output of this function is a partial subalgebra basis. This is unavoidable, since a subalgebra of a polynomial ring, endowed with some polynomial order, need not have a finite subalgebra basis.
	
	Here is a quintessential example of this phenomenon:
    Example
      R=QQ[x,y];
      A = subring matrix{{x+y,x*y,x*y^2}};
      gens sagbi(A,Limit=>3)
      gens sagbi(A,Limit=>10)
    Text
        Nevertheless, a finite subalgebra basis exists for many notable examples. 
        The following computation verifies a special case of Theorem 3.3 in "SAGBI bases with applications to blow-up algebras" by Conca, Herzog, and Valla.
    Example
        R=QQ[t,z_1..z_4,MonomialOrder=>{Weights=>{1,0,0,0,0},Lex}];
        M=matrix{{z_1,z_2,z_3},{z_2,z_3,z_4}};
        I=minors(2,M);
        A=subring(drop(gens R,1) | apply(I_*, p -> t* p));
        gens sagbi(A)
    Text
        Continuing with this example, we illustrate how the setting the option Limit may influence the output:
    Example
        subR = sagbi(A, Limit=>1);
	peek subR
        subR = sagbi(A, Limit=>6);
	peek subR
    Text
        The output of the last command is a finite Sagbi basis, but the computation necessary to verify this fact required setting Limit to at least 6.

        "SAGBI bases of subrings of quotient rings"
    Description
        Text
          The SAGBI algorithm implementation used in this package was originally written by Mike Stillman in approximately 1999
	  for the purpose of implementing concepts from the paper "Using SAGBI bases to compute invariants" by Stillman and Tsai.
	  Namely, the purpose was to be capable of calculating Sagbi bases of subrings contained in quotient rings. 
	  The code still retains this capability, but there are
	  some pecularities. Consider the following example: 
	  
	Example
	  gndR = QQ[x,y, MonomialOrder => Lex];
	  I = ideal(x^2 - x*y);
	  Q = gndR/I;
	  subR = sagbi subring {x};
	  gens subR
	  
	Text 
	
	  Because $x^2 = xy$ inside of the quotient ring $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x)$, the resulting Sagbi basis $(x)$ cannot be correct because
	  it does not involve $y$.
	
	  In this example, the algorithm terminated successfully because it has no way of knowing that $x^2 = xy$ inside of the
	  ambient ring of subR. Technically, one could argue that this isn’t a bug because it’s actually doing what it is
	  supposed to do according to the specification. Notice that the Sagbi algorithm’s proof of correctness in Proposition 3
	  of "Using SAGBI bases to compute invariants" by Stillman and Tsai does not apply when a finite Sagbi basis doesn’t exist. 
	  So, fixing this “bug” is really a question of whether or not it is possible to improve upon the underlying algorithm.
	  
	  What this means is that it is possible for the Sagbi algorithm to falsely succeed when the ambient ring is a quotient ring. 
	  However, when a finite SAGBI basis does happen to exist, the algorithm *should* be able to calculate it correctly given enough
	  time.
	  
	  The following is an example of a correct Sagbi computation over a subring of a quotient ring. It is an implementation of
	  Example 2 of Stillman and Tsai in the case $N=4$. 
	CannedExample
	  N = 4;
	  gndR = QQ[(a,b,c,d)|(u_1..u_N)|(v_1..v_N), MonomialOrder => Lex];
	  I = ideal(a*b - b*c - 1);
	  quot = gndR/I;
	  U = (vars quot)_{4..(N+3)}
	  V = (vars quot)_{(N+4)..(2*N+3)}
	  G = flatten for i from 0 to N-1 list(
    	      {a*(U_(0,i)) + b*(V_(0,i)), c*(U_(0,i)) + d*(V_(0,i))}

        "Experimental implementation of modules over subrings"
    Description
        Text
	  In order to explain how modules over subrings are implemented in this package, it will be helpful to look at an example. 
	  The following is an implementation of Example 11.19 from "Groebner bases and Convex Polytopes" by Bernd Sturmfels:
        CannedExample
	  i = 2;
	  gndR = QQ[t_1, t_2, t_3];
	  A := {t_1*t_2*t_3,

		t_1*t_3^2,
		t_2^2*t_3,
		t_2*t_3^2};
	  G := matrix {{t_1^(2*i)*t_2^(2*i)*t_3^(2*i), t_1^((3*i)+2)*t_2*t_3^(3*i)}}
	  subR = subring sagbi subring A;
	  assert((set first entries gens subR) === (set A)); 
	  tsyz := toricSyz(subR, G);
	  assert(tsyz * (transpose G) == 0);

	  ans1 = mingensSubring(subR, tsyz);

    	Text
	  This appears to agree with Sturmfels's prediction, although it is not possible to be entirely certain that this computation
	  is correct without knowing more than the information contained in the Sturmfels text. This is because Sturmfels does not 
	  fully specify what the set of minimal generators of this syzygy module are. Namely, it is only stated that it must include
	  $2i+2=6$ syzygies of total degree $i+1 = 3$.
	
	  The following code is the implementation of the function @TT "mingensSubring"@:
	  
	CannedExample	
	  -- Performs autoreduction on M treated as a module over subR.
	  mingensSubring = method(TypicalValue => Matrix)
	  mingensSubring(Subring, Matrix) := (subR, M) -> (  
	      (A, B, gVars)  := moduleToSubringIdeal(subR, M);
	      final := autoreduce(A, transpose B);
	      -- Sort the rows of the matrix for more predictable behavior.
	      final = matrix transpose {sort first entries transpose final};
	      final = extractEntries(final, gVars);
    	      subR#"PresRing"#"FullSub"(sub(final,subR#"presentation"#"tensorRing"))
	      );
	Text
	   The function @TT "mingensSubring"@ works by converting the given matrix (which should be thought of as a module) to an 
	   ideal inside of a subring, and then performing autoreduction on the generators of that ideal. It relies on the function
	   @TT "moduleToSubringIdeal"@ to construct a suitable subring and provide the generators that define this ideal.
	   
	   In order to understand how the function @TT "moduleToSubringIdeal"@ works, it is neccessary to understand some properties
	   of the @TO "Subring"@ type. Consider the output of the following command:
	CannedExample
	  i5 : debugPrintMap (subR#"presentation"#"fullSubstitution")
	  maps p_0 to t_1
	  maps p_1 to t_2
	  maps p_2 to t_3
	  maps p_3 to t_2*t_3^2
	  maps p_4 to t_1*t_3^2
	  maps p_5 to t_2^2*t_3
	  maps p_6 to t_1*t_2*t_3
	  maps p_7 to t_1^2*t_3
	  maps p_8 to t_1*t_2^2
	  maps p_9 to t_1^2*t_2
        Text
	  
	  @TT "p_1"@, ..., @TT "p_9"@ are the variables of what is refered to in the code as the "tensorRing". The @TT "tensorRing"@ of @TT "subR"@ has two parts:
	  the "lower variables," and the "upper variables."
	  
	  The variables @TT "p_0"@, @TT "p_1"@ and @TT "p_2"@ are the lower variables of @TT "subR#\"presentation\""@. They correspond to the variables of the "ambient ring"
	  of @TT "subR"@, which is @TT "gndR"@ in our original example. The upper variables of @TT "subR"@ are @TT "p_3"@, ..., @TT "p_9"@. These correspond to
	  generators of the subring.
	  
	  The following command converts the toric syzygy module from our example (which is returned by @TT "toricSyz"@ in the form of a matrix) to an ideal 
	  within a subring. This is identical to the @TT "moduleToSubring(subR, tsyz)"@ call that occurs in the first line of @TT "mingensSubring"@. 
	CannedExample
	   i15 : (modRing, idealGens, gVars) = moduleToSubringIdeal(subR, tsyz)

	   o15 = (subring of QQ[p_0..p_11], | -p_0^6p_2^3p_10+p_0^2p_1^3p_2p_11   |, | p_10 p_11 |)

    	Text
	  The ambient ring of @TT "modRing"@ is the tensor ring of @TT "subR"@, except two new variables @TT "p_10"@ and @TT "p_11"@ have been added.
	  The variables @TT "p_10"@ and @TT "p_11"@ correspond to the generators of the module. The generators @TT "p_12"@ and @TT "p_13"@ also correspond
	  to the generators of the module, except they are @ITALIC "upper"@ rather than @ITALIC "lower"@ variables.
	  
	  The primary reason why this implementation should be considered experimental is that the monomial order of a module is not fully specified. 
	  
	  When a @TO "Subring"@ instance is created using the function @TO "subring"@, the monomial order of the lower variables is the same as the monomial
	  order of their corresponding variables in the ambient ring while the monomial order of the upper variables is assigned arbitrarily. This monomial 
	  order is fine for the purposes of basic subring computations that this package's code was originally designed to perform. The problem with this system is 
	  that it is likely to cause bugs in the case where a subring's ambient ring is the tensor ring of another subring.

     Text
       If the second argument is a one-row matrix, subduction is performed on each entry 
       individually and the resulting one-row matrix is returned. If the second argument is
       a ring element @TT "f"@, subduction is performed on @TT "f"@ and the result is returned.

       The subring @TT "subR"@ is not required to be a Sagbi basis. The reasoning behind this is
       because it is not neccessary for the set of subring generators to be a Sagbi basis in order
       for the subduction algorithm to be well-defined.
            
     Example
       gndR = QQ[symbol t_1, symbol t_2, symbol t_3];

       The reason why this is exported is for extensibility purposes. Having access to @TT "makePresRing"@ makes it easier

       Converts elements of a subring ideal (represented by a one-column matrix) to elements 
       of a module (represented by a matrix.)

       Internally, the argument gVars is sorted so that the order of the columns of the resulting
       matrix is consistent.
       
     Example 
       R = QQ[a, b, c, x_1, x_2, x_3];
       extractEntries(matrix {{a*x_1 + b*x_2 + c*x_3}}, matrix {{x_1, x_2, x_3}})
       extractEntries(matrix {{a*x_1 + b*x_2 + c*x_3},{a*x_1 + a*x_2 + a*x_3}}, matrix {{x_1, x_2, x_3}} )

     Constructs a subring of a polynomial ring.
   Usage
     A = subring M
   Inputs
     M:Matrix
       A one-row matrix whose entries are the generators of the resulting subring.
     L:List 
       A list whose entries are the generators of the resulting subring.
     VarBaseName=>String
       Determines the symbol used for the variables of the @TT "tensorRing"@ of the resulting @TO "Subring"@ instance.
   Outputs
     A:Subring
   Description
     Text
       This function serves as the canonical constructor for the @TO "Subring"@ type.

       Generators that are constants are ignored because all subrings are assumed to contain the field of coefficients. An error is 
       thrown if the given set of generators does not contain atleast one non-constant generator. 

       The generators of a subring need not be reduced. For example, subrings with pairs of duplicated generators are acceptable.
     Example
       gndR = QQ[x];
       A = subring sagbi subring {x^4+x^3, x^2+x}
       (x^3+x^2)%A

     Attempt to write a ring element in terms of the generators of a subring.
   Usage

   Inputs
     f:RingElement
       An element

       A subring that is a Sagbi basis.

   Description
     Text 
       Internally, this function calculates a Groebner basis. The first call will take longer to perform than subsequence calls
       because this Groebner basis is stored in the cache of @TT "subR"@ after it is found. Another implication of this is that
       it may take a very long time to compute for difficult subrings.   
       
       Doubts have been expressed about the theoretical basis of this function.
     Example
       gndR = QQ[x];
       A = subring sagbi subring {x^4+x^3, x^2+x}
       gens A
       f = x^3 + x^2

   Description
     Text
      Returns true if the subring was generated from a finite sagbi basis using the command @TO "(subring,SAGBIBasis)"@.  Note that this function does not perform a sagbi computation, so it does not confirm that a generating set is a sagbi basis.
